        <h2>ABOUT KARNATAKA VIKAS GRAMEENA BANK</h2><br>
        <h2>origin:</h2><br>
        <p>
            Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) represent an innovation in Indian Banking. The innovation is unique in terms of its objectives, functions, area of operation and clientele. For this reasons, RRBs can be regarded as specialized Institutions, i.e. distinct from commercial banks as well as Co-operative credit agencies.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            The Banking Commission in the year 1972 observed that despite the massive expansion of branch network of commercial Banks in the rural areas, a vast segment of the rural population comprising weaker sections and economically backward classes were deprived of banking facilities as their requirements were small and financing them by commercial banks was perceived to be a non-viable proposition. The Commission felt that an alternative credit delivery mechanism by way of setting up of specialized Banks, particularly to cater to these segments of the population, could be explored by the Government. Based on the recommendations of Narasimhan Committee which gave its report in 1975, the Government of India decided to set up Regional Rural Bank (RRBs). Regional rural Banks Ordinance was promulgated by the President of India on September 26,1975. Accordingly, Five RRBs started functioning from 2nd October 1975. The Ordinance was subsequently replaced by the Regional Rural Bank’s Act, 1976 dated February 9,1976. This Act provide for incorporation, regulation and winding up Regional Rural Banks. This Act contains all provisions for the proper functioning of RRBs and its supervision by NABARD and RBI as a regulator.

        <h3>MISSION:</h3><br>
        <p>
            “Developing the rural economy by providing for the purpose of development of Agriculture, Trade, Commerce, Industry and other productive activities in the rural areas, credit and other facilities, particularly to the small and marginal farmers, Agricultural Labourers, Artisans and small entrepreneurs and for matters connected therewith and individuals thereto”.
        </p><br>
        <h3>A JOURNEY OF PROGRESS:</h3><br>
        <p>
            RRBs faced many ups and downs during the last 46 years since its inception because it was a new and unique concept ever implemented in the country. The number of RRBs which increased from 5 to 196 during expansion phase from 1976 to 1986 showed the willingness of Govt. of India and the concerned State Governments looking to its objectives. Various recommendations of Committee pointed out the need of increasing the size of RRBs to make them economical viable. With this view the “merger” of RRBs took place during 2005 onwards. They are successfully competing with their banking counter parts in rural areas with the implementation of computerization and Core Banking solutions (CBS) with the active support of Govt. of India and NABARD.

        <h3>capital:</h3><br>
        <p>
            Initially, the authorized share capital of each Rural Bank was Rs. One Crore, divided into 1 lakh shares of Rs. 100/- each. 50 % of the issued capital was subscribed by the Central government, 15% by the Concerned State Government and 35% by the Sponsor Bank. With the enactment of RRBs (Amendment) Act, 1987, the authorized capital of each RRB has been raised to Rs. 5 Crores and paid up Capital to Rs. One Crore. The Board of Directors of Rural Bank may, after consultation with the Reserve Bank and Sponsoring Bank and with the prior approval of Central Government, increase the issued Capital from time to time.
        </p><br>
        <h3>management:</h3><br>
        <p>
            A RRB transacts its business as per the direction of the Board of Directors. The policies of Central Government ,Reserve Bank of India, NABARD and Sponsor Bank are put up before the Board for its approval. Therefore, the general superintendence and management of the affairs and business of a RRB vest in the Board. The Board of directors consists of the Chairman and the following members, namely;
