    <h2>Key Benefits of Health Insurance Plans</h2>
    <p>Flexibility: With a fixed benefit health insurance plan you get the flexibility to choose the utilisation of the sum assured. Critical illnesses like heart and kidney diseases can take a heavy financial and mental toll on the family. The overall expenses could be substantial ranging from treatment cost to the loss of livelihood in some cases. The payout of fixed benefit health insurance does not depend on the actual cost of treatment. It can help you take care of the different costs related to a critical illness.
        Hassle-free claim process: You do not have to produce hundreds of bills and documents to claim the sum assured. The claim process of fixed-benefit health insurance is simple and hassle-free. Just a report from the doctor specifying the condition is enough to receive the payout.
        Premium waiver: The diagnosis of a critical illness is a difficult situation for all family members. Health insurance cover continues even after a minor claim is made, but the insured is not required to pay the premiums. With the premium waiver, the insuredâ€™s family does not have to worry about losing the health insurance cover.
        Increasing cover: The cost of healthcare is on the rise, but a good health insurance policy takes care of inflation. Canara HSBC Life Insurance Health First Plan comes with an increasing cover option, which helps the insured take care of the rising cost of medical care. With the option, the sum assured increases at a pre-defined rate nullifying the impact of healthcare inflation.</p>

        <h2>Things to Consider Before You Pick a Health Insurance Plan</h2>
        <p>
            Claim Process:The claim process is an important factor for all insurance products as no one wants to run from pillar to post when the need arises. You should choose a health insurance plan with a simple and fast claim process. A helpful customer support system would be an additional advantage.
            The insurance amount:The amount of cover is one of the most critical components of a health insurance plan as an inadequate amount will not be of much help. While choosing the insurance amount, take into consideration your age and history of diseases.. You should also keep in mind your income while choosing the premiums. Essentially, you should try to strike a balance between the insurance amount and the premiums.
            Family health insurance: The health of your family members is as important as yours while taking a health insurance plan. Take into account the existing ailments and the age of your family members while choosing a health insurance plan.
            Pre/post hospitalisation: There are several costs related to hospitalisation. Ideally, one should choose medical insurance that covers pre and post hospitalisation charges. The pre and post hospitalisation expenses include the cost of consultation and diagnostic tests.
